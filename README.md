# Not-Bing
### This is a simple search engine which sometimes works(unlike Bing).

Welcome to Not-Bing – your friendly neighborhood search engine that definitely isn’t Bing. It’s a straightforward tool built because I wanted to learn about search engines.

## Key Features:
- Random Results: Because who needs relevance?
- No Fancy Features: Just the essentials.
- Potential for Improvement: Lots of room to grow, if I can ever figure out how.
