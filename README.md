### Your Search, Cherry-Picked.

Cherry – your friendly neighborhood search engine that finds what you are looking for (sometimes). It’s a pretty simple search engine I made in my free time because I wanted to learn about search engines.

## Fetures and How to Use:
- Install requirements.txt
- from base directory run "python run.py"
- Open Localhost:5050
- You can start scraping from the homepage. Every page being scraped will be shown in the console.
- You can change the base url for scraping from app/routes.py
- You can see the database at localhost:5050/database
- Search functionality works as intended.
- There is nothing fancy in this implementation this is as basic search engine as it gets.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Flask
- SQLite
